## 🔐 VPN Concepts Researched

### 🔸 What is a VPN?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure, encrypted connection over the internet, allowing users to safely transmit data and hide their real IP address.

### 🔸 How Does It Work?
VPNs route internet traffic through an encrypted tunnel between your device and the VPN server.

### 🔸 Protocols Used:
- OpenVPN
- WireGuard
- IKEv2

### 🔸 Encryption:
ProtonVPN uses **AES-256** encryption, which is military-grade and currently considered unbreakable.
